[📥Download the Full Audit Report (PDF)](IT-Audit-Report-Botium-Toys.pdf)

## 📝 Project Overview
This project consists of a comprehensive internal IT audit for **Botium Toys**, a fictional toy retailer expanding globally. The goal was to assess the company's security posture, identify vulnerabilities, and ensure compliance with international regulations (**GDPR**, **PCI DSS**) using the **NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF)**.

## 🎯 Objectives
* Evaluate existing IT assets and infrastructure.
* Conduct a risk assessment to identify threats and vulnerabilities.
* Complete a controls and compliance checklist.
* Provide strategic recommendations to mitigate a high risk score (8/10).

## 🔍 Audit Components

### 1. Risk Assessment
The audit identified critical gaps in the "Identify", "Protect", and "Detect" functions of the NIST CSF. 
* **High Risk Score:** 8/10
* **Critical Findings:** Lack of data encryption, absence of disaster recovery plans, and inadequate access controls (Least Privilege).

### 2. Controls & Compliance Checklist
I evaluated the current state of security controls. Below is a summary of the findings:

| Control Category | Status |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Firewall & Antivirus** | ✅ Implemented |
| **Physical Security (CCTV/Locks)** | ✅ Implemented |
| **Data Encryption (At Rest/Transit)** | ❌ Missing |
| **Intrusion Detection System (IDS)** | ❌ Missing |
| **Disaster Recovery / Backups** | ❌ Missing |
| **Least Privilege Access** | ❌ Missing |

### 3. Regulatory Compliance
* **PCI DSS:** Non-compliant due to lack of encryption and weak password policies.
* **GDPR:** Partially compliant; breach notification plan is in place, but data privacy and classification need improvement.

## 💡 Strategic Recommendations
1.  **Encryption & Backups:** Implement AES-256 encryption and off-site backups immediately.
2.  **Access Management:** Deploy an IAM system to enforce the Principle of Least Privilege.
3.  **Monitoring:** Install an IDS to enhance threat detection capabilities.
4.  **Policy Update:** Modernize password requirements and implement centralized management.
